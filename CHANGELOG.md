## 0.6.1 (2023-08-18)

## 0.5.0 (2023-05-26)

### Added

- Added cartesian coordinates to Poi instances.

## 0.4.0 (2023-03-30)

### Added

- SDKConfiguration may include an optional _lang_ parameter to override the _Accept-Language_ HTTP header. Fallsback to "en" if no language is provided. This avoids known issues when retrieving translated entities (bad translations due to sending arbitrary Accept-Language headers).

  Usage example:

```js
const SitumSDK = require("@situm/sdk-js");

const situmSDK = new SitumSDK({
  auth: {
    apiKey: "MY-API-KEY",
    email: "MY-EMAIL",
  },
  domain: "https://dashboard.situm.com",
  lang: "es",
});
```

Technically you could use any [standard Accept-Language values](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-accept-encoding) but we recommend to stick to [ISO_639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1), avoiding language variants. For example, don't use "es-GB", use "es" instead.

## 0.3.0 (2022-11-02)

### Added

- Handler for fetching the current organization info (activated modules, logos, accent colors)

### Improvements

- Add base domain to the poi categories icon urls. This fixes image urls pointing to wrong environment.
